## Complete data analyis of 3 hotels of MORGENS
This analysis was prepared for the DATA36 education platform’s December 2024 challenge. My work was selected among the top 3 highest-rated analyses, which allowed me to present it in front of a jury of senior data scientists and an audience on December 11, 2024. 
## Dataset
The analysis was conducted using 11 CSV files per hotel, covering 3 hotels in total. The dataset contains fresh, real-life data on hotel occupancy, realized bookings, customer searches, marketing campaigns, and the amount spent on each marketing channel.
## Main questions
- Analysis of marketing elements (sources, mediums, campaigns) and conversion performance.
- Comprehensive analysis of search, booking, and occupancy data.
- Based on search, booking, and occupancy data, is it possible to develop a warning system to monitor marketing costs and maximize occupancy while maintaining optimal pricing?
## Key Findings
- Bookings and searches are mainly concentrated around holiday periods (school autumn break, Christmas/New Year) and weekends.
- Booking window: Guests make reservations 3–4 months in advance. Two peaks exist: 2–3 days before booking and 96–97 days in advance.
- Conversion: 2–9% of searches for specific dates result in actual bookings.
- Guest types: Families with children and Hungarian guests prefer longer advance planning.
- Average stay: 2.55 nights; families with children search for longer stays but actually stay shorter periods.
- Room types: Three are the most popular (EE, FF, GG), but families with children prefer the other three types (AA, DD, CC).
- Marketing channels:
  - Google: most cost-effective, strong correlation with paid visitors (79%)
  - Meta: least cost-effective, correlation 92%
  - Microsoft: weak correlation with paid visitors (11%)
- All three channels have moderate correlation with bookings (38–46%)
- Campaigns: 8 major campaigns drove the majority of paid visitors.
- User behavior on website: visitor → search → booking.
## Optimization Recommendations
- Advertising cost per booking ≤ 5% or 10,000 HUF per booking; intervene if exceeded for 3 consecutive days.
- Continuous measurement: track conversions weekly/monthly; aim to convert more website visitors into searchers and searches into bookings.
- Focus on the best-performing platform (for Hotel 1: Google).
- Remarketing: target users who started but did not complete bookings.
- Campaign planning:
  - For Hungarian audience: start campaigns 3–4 months in advance
  - For foreign audience: shorter lead time is sufficient
  - For families with children: consider campaigns supporting longer stays
